# Project Details

## Project Title: Dental Clinic Management System

## Problem Statement:
Nowadays for any business operating in the market the process of data management and workflow needs to be optimized to facilitate the daily operations. As everything now runs digital, keeping large paper documents, organizing and retrieving them can be a tedious task. Especially for a clinic that has a direct communication with the client every day which leads to a time consuming activity. In the Albanian market this problem is still present as clinics are using still the old-fashioned manner for storing data manually on papers or using old software’s that aren’t efficient for their activities. 

## Solution Proposed:
My idea to solve this problem is creating a software that offers a method for automating and digitalizing every procedure that a clinic performs on a daily basis. The new system will help facilitating the data workflow, retrieving data in real time, improving the interaction with the clients by increasing efficiency and also having a better user experience for the ones using an outdated software.


## Project Scope:
- **Aim:** The aim of this Dental Clinic Management System is to manage and automate all the processes that take place in a dental clinic medical department, that would have been done manually. 
- **Main Objectives:**
1.	To provide various functionalities to the users that help reduce the time needed to keep all the patients’ records, prescriptions or scheduled appointments and access them in the shortest time possible. 
2.	To store and back up data in a safe place, in order to prevent any data loss. 
3.	To keep track all the information of the patients into a management system, the doctors will be able to assess the risks and the progress of their patients.


## Application Description:
The scope of this product is to create a generic Dental Clinic Management System that can be implemented in any dental clinic and it can be later customized for deployment and integration based on the needs of our clients. The aim of the product is to create a management system that assists the users in different activities that take place in an dental clinic: scheduling doctor-patient appointments, storing patient’s personal and medical information, storing the treatments prescribed, keeping record of the patients’ diagnosis and accessing all this information in real time.
